It's been a while, huh? Sooo, I'm a fan of [Eevee's Blog](https://eev.ee/), so I've decided to ~~shamelessly copy~~ imitate what they do every week; a roundup of what happened the previous week! Surely this is something I can follow up on and keep reasonably updated with...

**blog:** I've been a bit busy lately, but I'm going to try to get back into writing. I have some planned bits surrounding changes and progress to [Untitled](http://glaciate.net/blog/post/game-assignment-elevator-pitch/), just need to actually...write something. I made some much needed design changes too, the site looks better than ever!

**life:** my assignments are all (kinda!) done! I have 2 exams and my last game design assignment due in just over a month. Not worrying! Maybe!

**streaming:** I'm looking to get back into streaming game development (I even went and fixed up all of my OBS settings and made a pretentious-looking overlay, [see!](overlay.png)) to go along with my original promise.

**gaming:** I got a Switch with Breath of the Wild! Well, I've had it since launch but I've finished the main game and have almost all shrines completed. I also borrowed a friend's PlayStation Vita and Persona 4 Golden and have been greatly enjoying that in the short time I can have with it, in preparation for Persona 5!
