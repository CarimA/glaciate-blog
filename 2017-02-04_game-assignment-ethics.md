It's just like Animal Crossing...what's the problem? But then we remember that this is an online game, so I'll have to turn my thinking around anyway...

# Online Play
It's no secret that the bulk of the issues with online games can be attributed to players: moderation is subjective and good moderation is expensive; there will always be loopholes or uncooperative users, even if the game itself is completely morally sound, there will be at least 1 player to make it otherwise. It goes without saying that there needs to be a comprehensive and clear set of rules and a clear reporting system in-game.

The game isn't aimed at children, but being online, there will have to be some effort (or at the very least, a disclaimer) to prevent children from being able to create an account. 

For some time while the game is in active development up until a stable release, I aim to collect usage statistics such as computational power, screen resolutions and time logged in through an **opt-out** scheme. I also plan to have an **opt-in** system that randomly takes screenshots of the game and uploads them to Imgur for promotional purposes. 

# Content
There isn't going to be any remotely sexist, homophobic or hateful content (or anything that could even remotely be misconstrued as such) because it simply isn't a part of the content.

Note that I didn't say "racism". While there is no actual racist intent, there are plans for real-time events throughout the year for various culteral holidays that distribute cultural-related clothing and furniture options, being seen as culteral appropriation is a concern.

The best I can do here is to ensure that I do my research on each event to ensure that I do them justice and bring awareness to what could be a uniting time.
